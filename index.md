# About Me

Hi folks, I am Varun Verma. I live in Chandigarh, India with my friends, family, laptop and a whole lot of gadget thingies. I am weaning as a developer and designer, being a college student. And this blog, its content and opinions are my own.

I spend time programming, developing android apps and games. Besides developing I love designing, making new designs whether it is website design, random text, effects etc. I am a boot strapped developer, gaining experience and as for now i am aspired for attainment of omniscience.

I am foodaholic, cannot help myself when I see my cherished delight on table. I may look sobersided, but I am not. I have this inquisitiveness in me, always pulled toward learning new things. I am determined but adamant at the same time. I watch lot of TV series. I donâ€™t like falling asleep, but when I do I sleep for hours.

Varun is Software Developer at Zomato. He has experience of developing apps in android, website designing in photoshop and has sound knowledge of photoshop, flash, after effects and few other rendering softwares. He knows various programming languages like Java,C, C++, PHP, HTML, CSS3 along with fair knowledge of Android libraries and little of WordPress. He blogs at http://varunest.com.
