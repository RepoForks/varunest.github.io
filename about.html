<b>Too Much Information</b>
<br><br>
I am foodaholic, cannot help myself when I see my cherished delight on table. I may look sobersided, but I am not. I have this inquisitiveness in me, always pulled toward learning new things. I am determined but adamant at the same time. I watch lot of TV series. I don’t like falling asleep, but when I do I sleep for hours.
